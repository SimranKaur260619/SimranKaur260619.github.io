# ESSENTIAL OF LINUX/UNIX COMMANDS
## Welcome to my GitHub Pages
##### This is my first Github Webpage. I am using this first time in my training duration. My first task is to present essential of Linux/Unix commands using GitHub Pages. Let's have a look!
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because it’s a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.

## Navigating Files and Directories
**1. pwd**

pwd stands for "print the working directory". Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before running a command is important. pwd shows you where you are:

**2. ls**

ls prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory. We can make its output more comprehensible by using the -F option which tells ls to classify the output by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:

-a trailing / indicates that this is a directory

-@ indicates a link

-indicates an executable

Depending on your shell’s default settings, the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.
