# ESSENTIAL OF LINUX/UNIX COMMANDS
## Welcome to my GitHub Pages
##### This is my first Github Webpage. I am using this first time in my training duration. My first task is to present essential of Linux/Unix commands using GitHub Pages. Let's have a look!
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because itâ€™s a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.
